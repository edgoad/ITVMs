# ITVMs
Documentation and scripts for the IT Department VMs

To run, open the Hyper-V server and start executing chunks of the first script (01-MainSetup.ps1)
 - If you are unsure which chunks should run together, execute line by line

When finished with the first script, install the OS on the Virtual Machines
 - ensure the password is set

Run the next script (20-MainSetup.ps1) in chunks
 - This runs against the VMs 
 
When everything is good, run the last script to capture the VM state
